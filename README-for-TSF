1. Compiling Commands
 1.1 Preparation for Compiling
   - Step 1: You need to install GSL library in your home directory.
             GSL library can be obtained in the following URL:
             http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
			 
   - Step 2: Modify GSL_INCLUDE and GSL_LIBRARY in Makefile 
             with the directory of GSL library.
   
 1.2 Make the execution file
  $make
   -> The execution binary is vanet

 1.3 Make the debugging binary
  $make all.db
   -> The execution binary is vanet.db

2. Run TSF
 2.1 Basic Running
  $vanet 

 2.2 Running with Target Point Computation Methods
  $vanet -C 1 /* TSF */
  $vanet -C 2 /* Last Trajectory Point (LTP) */
  $vanet -C 3 /* Random Trajectory Point (RTP) */
 
3. Configuration files
 3.1 Simulation parameter configuration file
  This configuration file is ./param-configuration/param-for-download.conf

 3.2 Road network graph configuration file
  This configuration file is ./graph-configuration/graph-node49-for-vanet-with-multiple-APs-for-download.conf 

 * NOTE: These two configurations can be changed at common.h using the following variables:
	#define CONF_FILE_FOR_DOWNLOAD "./param-configuration/param-for-download.conf"
	#define GRAPH_FILE_FOR_NODES_49_WITH_MULTIPLE_AP_FOR_DOWNLOAD "./graph-configuration/graph-node49-for-vanet-with-multiple-APs-for-download.conf"

Enjoy this simulator!
