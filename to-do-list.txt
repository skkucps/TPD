1. upgrade the communication for the data forwarding at intersection
such that the communication range is circle rather than square.

2. accommodate any kind of road network graphs rather as well as the grid-style road network graph.
 - The computation of the angle from vehicle towards AP or the distance from vehicle to AP can be performed
  in the any kind of road network graphs.
 - The distance is substituted for the angle in the selection order for the preferred data forwarding edges.

1. For the directional edge with no vehicle arrival, the edge's mean link delay is the edge's length divided by mean vehicle speed and the link delay standard deviation is zero.

[03/05/2009]
1. Verify the correctness of the simulation using the linear network configuration.
 - In the high density road network, the delivery delay should be close to zero.

2. Modify the computation of EDD
 - Regard the infinite edge (i.e., no edge) with no or a few arrivals of vehicles.
 - Use the shortest path in terms of the aggregated delivery delay to order the edges for 
   computing the forwarding probability.
 - This modified version is used for TBD, so the previous version is used for VADD.
   . I need to make another function for TBD using (i) the delivery-delay shortest path and 
     (ii) the geographically shortest path.

3. Vehicular traffic generation
 - Generate vehicle arrivals per directional edge
 - When the vehicle arrives at the exit of the directional edge,
   the vehicle forwards its packets to another vehicle moving 
   on another directional edge incident to the head of the original edge.

4. Design with Relay nodes
 - We compute the EDD considering the relay nodes, such as the mean waiting time at relay nodes
   before the packet can be relayed to the vehicles passing the relay nodes.
   . Refer to the Mobicom08 paper titled as "Relays, Base Stations, and Meshes: Enhancing Mobile
     Networks with Infrastructure".

1. To show the impact of the vehicle speed deviation, we let vehicles changes its speed 
at intersections on the trajectory.

[07/22/2009]
1. Is the mean speed the same regardless of the vehicle speed deviation?
  - Yes, for a normal distribution N(mu,sigma), the mean is mu for any normal distribution.
 
*2. K-anonymous Trajectory-Based Data Forwarding (KTBDF)
  - For a destination vehicle, AP generates k packets with k independent paths to guarantee k-anonymity.
    i) How to define independent paths?
       - Can we use the independence of vectors in linear algebra?

    ii) How to determine the transmission order of k packets?
       - we can use a random permutation function to mix up the packet order?

3. Vehicle Trajectory Management according to Mobility Type
 - In v1.0.5, MOBILITY_OPEN is supported, but MOBILITY_CLOSED is not supported yet.
   . This vehicle trajectory installation is performed at Install_VehicleTrajectory_Into_Packet()
     in queue.c.

[07/25/2009]
1. Handling of the expired trajectory packets that the destination vehicle has gone out of its trajectory due to the long delivery time from AP to this carrier vehicle.
  - The packet chooses a random target point among the intersections on the road network graph 
  - Then it sets its trajectory selection type as static. 
  - If this packet meets another vehicle with fresh destination vehicle, it is forwarded with the packet with the fresh destination vehicle trajectory.

[07/30/2009]
1. TTL setting
 - the destination vehicle travel time for the trajectory
   1413 seconds
 - TTL can be set to the travel time, such as 1413 sec.
 - However, at this point, TTL is set to 3600 sec for high delivery ratio.

2. Vehicle speed change
 - each vehicle updates its speed whenever it arrives at a new intersection.
   . at run() in main.c, we use set_vehicle_speed().

3. New Dynamic Target Point Selection
 - When at the EAD_p the packet does not arrive the target point p, the packet should select a new target point since the destination vehicle has already passed the target point p with high probability.

 - When the packet arrives at target point earlier than the destination vehicle, the packet should select a new target point towards the destination vehicle since the destination has not arrived at target point p yet.

 -* Update the function of VADD_Update_Vehicle_EDD_And_EDD_SD_For_Download() in vadd.c for Dynamic target point update

4. Dynamic target point selection makes a routing loop:
 - Command: $vanet -S 3 -j 1 -u 15000 -s 3

[08/03/09-v1.1.8]
1. We need to draw the system behavior of three target point selection methods in terms of average delivery delay and delivery ratio.

[09/29/09-v1.3.1]
1. Computation of the EDD_VAR at intersection
 - at VADD_Compute_EDD_And_EDD_SD_For_TargetPoint_At_Intersection() in vadd.c 
 - Change
   . OLD:
     EDD_VAR += directional_edge_EDD_VAR * forwarding_probability;

   . NEW:
     EDD_VAR += directional_edge_EDD_VAR * pow(forwarding_probability, 2);

[10/06/09-v1.3.3]
1. Link Delay Discrepancy between Simulation and Math Model in TBD
 - The reason is that we use a static node to generate packets on road segment.
   When there is no vehicle to deliver the generated packets, the packets are waiting for 
   a carrier to come to the tail of the edge.
   So we need to consider this waiting like in TBDF link delay model.

 - Or we can let the packet carrier arrive with one packet without a static node 
   at the tail of the edge.
   In this case, we can ignore the waiting time because the packet carrier will carry its packet
   when there is no predecessor vehicle.

[10/10/09-v1.3.6]
1. Construction of convoy
 - The EDD of a vehicle is set to the link delay to the head of the edge.
 - This setting lets the vehicle with the greatest offset among the connected network component in
the one-way road segment be the convoy header and leader.
 - Or the EDD of a vehicle is set to the EDD from its current position to the target point.

[10/29/09-v1.4.4]
1. With a random waiting time (uniform distribution with the interval (0,5) seconds) at each intersection, the EDD estimation accurary is a little lower than no-waiting-time case.
 - During the protocol development, I will use no-waiting-time setting and use waiting-time setting later.

2. Effect of Reliable Delivery to TCP in STBD
 - If the packet delivery ratio is high, i.e., with highly reliable delivery,
it can reduce the retransmission of segments in TCP layer due to packet loss or duplicate ACKs.

3. Optimization for Target Point
 - Let EPD be expected packet delay and EVD be expected vehicle delay.
 - Optimization Formula 1
   i* <- arg min EVD 
       i \in Dst_Vehicle_Trajectory
   subject to EVD - EPD >= beta
  
   Let SPD be the standard deviation of packet delay.
   Let SVD be the standard deviation of vehicle delay.
   The condition that the packet will arrive at the intersection i earlier than the vehicle is "EPD + c*SPD <= EVD - c*SVD" where c is a coefficient (e.g., 3).
   Thus, EVD - EPD >= c*SVD + c*SPD = beta.
   (Note that Tian's opinion is that this optimization also assumes the Gaussian distributions of PD and VD. For other distributions, c can be 3.)

 - Optimization Formula 2
   i* <- arg min EVD 
       i \in Dst_Vehicle_Trajectory
   subject to P(PD > VD) <= epsilon
   
   "P(PD > VD) <= epsilon" is that the probability that Packet arrives at intersection i later than Vehicle is epsilon (e.g., 0.1).
